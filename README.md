# Smiling Friends Fan Game

## MVP:

- 2D platformer based on Smiling Friends, with more than 100vh (like Terraria).
- Assets done by me
- The character moves with the arrow keys, and has attacks with the QWER system (one melee, one ranged, one for movement, and a ultimate).
- The melee attacks with fists until picking up a sword, the ranged throws rocks until picking up a bow or gun (the gun is pretty hidden, but also really OP if you find it), the ultimate is magic based.
- Each attack has a recharge time
- There is a wiki for enemies. They are unknown until you find them, and then you can read about them in the wiki. There is also a wiki for guns with the same principle.
- The final boss has a healthbar.

## FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:

- You can play as Pim, Charlie, Alan, Glep and Mr. Boss (you have to buy characters with in-game money in the game shop).
- There are several levels, and some cutscenes
